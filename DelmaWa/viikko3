EasyB doesn't seem particulary easy or convenient.
I had done static analysis to my code before with Checkstyle and PMD, but Sonar was new to me and seems superb for it.
It would also be nice to have way to add String and other such things as beans from annotations or from code.
What I resulted doing is that I extended File to create the user file so I could use @Component for it.
